# Stuff To Do, a.k.a. Nice-to-Haves

## Last updated March 5th, 2019 at 10:38 PM

- Add a proper database deployer. This project is probably too small to make use of anything like that but it would be nice, complete with a Schema table in the database so that we don't re-run setup scripts that have already been run.
- Set up a Country table in the DB that would have CountryCode, which can then be a foreign key to the UserProfile table.
- Set up a CI/CD pipeline, and unit tests.
- None of this stuff is probably going to happen, btw.
- I wanted to set this up with Docker, but having to redownload Postgres is a pain.
